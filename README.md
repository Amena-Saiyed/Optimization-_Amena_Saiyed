### Introduction

This project explores heuristic techniques to solve constrained optimization problems, focusing on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and its hybrid version with Genetic Algorithm (PSO-GA). These methods are applied to a set of challenging benchmark functions from the CEC 2017 competition, known for their complexity and relevance in testing optimization algorithms.

### Key Components

- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** A population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds flocking. It is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling non-linear and multi-modal optimization problems.
  
- **PSO-GA Hybrid:** A hybrid algorithm that combines the strengths of PSO and Genetic Algorithms (GA). This hybrid approach enhances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the optimization process, aiming for improved performance on complex optimization problems.
  
- **CEC 2017 Benchmark Functions:** A comprehensive set of test functions designed for the special session and competition on real-parameter optimization at the 2017 Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC). These functions are used to evaluate and compare the performance of different optimization algorithms.

### Project Goals

- Implement and compare the performance of PSO and PSO-GA on the CEC 2017 benchmark functions.
- Analyze and visualize the convergence behavior of the algorithms.
- Provide statistical metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of each optimization technique.

### Repository Contents

- **Code Implementation:** Python scripts for PSO, PSO-GA, and benchmark functions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Statistical analysis of the optimization results.
- **Convergence Plots:** Visualizations of the algorithms' convergence behavior.
- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the algorithms and benchmark functions used.

This project aims to provide insights into the capabilities of heuristic optimization techniques and their application to challenging optimization problems.
